(b) would, if granted, cover any implementation, use, or combination of
    technologies described in this Software, including but not limited to:
    - Hardware timer-based phase calculation methods
    - Sinusoidal modulation algorithms for visual entrainment
    - Theta-range frequency generation techniques
    - Safety protocols for flicker-based stimulation devices
    - Mandala visualization algorithms
    - Phase synchronization enhancement methods

This prohibition applies to all patent claims, whether filed by You, Your
affiliates, or any entity under Your control or direction, and extends to
patents filed in any jurisdiction worldwide.
